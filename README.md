# Concert Gate Simulation Project

This project simulates a computer-based model of a concert gate system, where attendees are processed through separate queues depending on whether they have backpacks or not.

## Project Structure

### 1. **rozklad.py**
   This file is responsible for generating random arrival times of attendees using the **Weibull distribution**.

### 2. **klasy.py**
   Defines the **classes** for both gates and attendees:
   - Attendees are divided into two categories: those with backpacks and those without.
   - Each group is handled in separate queues for optimized processing.

### 3. **MainPetlaB.py**
   The core of the simulation. It includes:
   - The main **simulation loop**.
   - A simple **UI** that allows users to easily run the simulation program.

### 4. **wizualizacja wynik√≥w.py**
   This file handles the **visualization** of the simulation results, providing clear graphical outputs.

### 5. **DOKUMENTACJA...**
   This file contains the **documentation** for the entire project, detailing the methodology, structure, and usage of the system.

This project simulates real-life scenarios, modeling the flow and processing of people entering through concert gates, providing both practical insights and clear visual representation of results.
